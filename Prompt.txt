Welcome to UNT!
As members of the UNT community, we have all made a commitment to be part of an institution that respects and values the identities of the students and employees with whom we interact. UNT does not tolerate identity-based discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. UNT’s full Non-Discrimination Policy can be found in the UNT Policies section of the syllabus.

Land Acknowledgment: Acknowledging the land is an Indigenous protocol, and it is important to note that the University of North Texas is located on the unceded territory of the Wichita and Caddo Affiliated Tribes. It is important to study the long processes that have brought us all to reside on this land, and to seek to better understand our places within these histories.

Why History?
History is the sum total of human experience in all its complexity. It is also the only guide we have to the decisions that will shape our future. The study of history allows us to see parallels, analogies, and recurrent patterns, detect long-term trends and forces, and understand what is really different about the present. History shows us how past decisions shape and limit future options and how every facet of life is socially and culturally constructed. Equally important, history exposes us to the full richness of human experience and introduces us to fascinating individuals and events and to long-term processes that gradually transform our lives.

Course Description
This course covers Early America as one of the most exciting and dramatic periods in the history of the Western world. These first two centuries brought political, social, and ideological revolutions. Yet, Early American history also hosted some of the darkest chapters in world history– the rise of imperialism, the exploitation of native peoples, systematized enslavement, and the subjugation of groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, class, and religion. In some ways, the course will be a broad survey of the social, political, economic, cultural, and intellectual history of the United States from British Colonization to the Civil War.  We will also investigate more specific themes such as: American settlement and diversity, ideas of race and gender, American culture, religion, civil and human rights, technological changes, economic change, immigration and migration, and the creation of federal government.

Course Structure
This is a remote course that will be conducted entirely online. You will have 15 modules of history units to work through in this 8-week course, averaging 2 modules every week. Because we will be employing various approaches to historical study this semester, your engagement with each component included in your modules, should aid you in gaining a deeper understanding of historical analysis as well as a more personal connection to history.

Course Prerequisites or Other Restrictions
No prerequisites for the course.

Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.Define key historical terms, individuals, ideas, events, and the significance of each in American history.
2.Draw direct connections between historical events and the consequential impact.
3.Critically analyze historical primary sources.
4.Apply the foundational knowledge of history to understanding present circumstances.
5.Identify the significance of why we study history.

Materials
1.Your textbook is an open-source reader that can be accessed online with no subscription or sign-in. In each module, you will have listed chapter readings and primary sources that can be accessed through this online textbook: American Yawp: A Massively Collaborative Open U.S. History Textbook.

Teaching Philosophy
I am a very student-centered instructor. I don't want to simply deposit knowledge into you. Instead, I design course content and assignments that allow students the opportunity to think critically and analytically on how they are relating and reacting to the content we're learning. Each of you is valued in this course for your different experiences, identities, learning styles, and your voices.

Rules of Engagement
Rules of engagement refer to the way students are expected to interact with each other and with their instructors. Here are some general guidelines:
1.While the freedom to express yourself is a fundamental human right, any communication that utilizes cruel and derogatory language on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law will not be tolerated.
2.Treat your instructor and classmates with respect in any communication online or face-to-face, even when their opinion differs from your own.
3.Ask for and use the correct name and pronouns for your instructor and classmates.
4.Speak from personal experiences. Use “I” statements to share thoughts and feelings. Try not to speak on behalf of groups or other individual’s experiences.
5.Use your critical thinking skills to challenge other people’s ideas, instead of attacking individuals.
6.Avoid using all caps while communicating digitally. This may be interpreted as “YELLING!”
7.Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm in emails or discussion posts as tone can be difficult to interpret digitally.
8.Avoid using “text-talk” unless explicitly permitted by your instructor.
9.Proofread and fact-check your sources.
10.Keep in mind that online posts can be permanent, so think first before you type.

You will receive an email alert when SPOT evaluations will be opening.

Course Policies
Assignment Policy
All assignments will be submitted through our course platform online. You can find all assignment due dates in the syllabus. You can also find the due dates and instructions when clicking on each assignment for details in Coursera. Any written assignments should be submitted as either .DOC or .PDF.

Technical Difficulties: The University is committed to providing a reliable online course system to all users. However, in the event of any unexpected server outage or any unusual technical difficulty which prevents students from completing a time sensitive assessment activity, the instructor will extend the time windows and provide an appropriate accommodation based on the situation. Students should immediately report any problems to the instructor and contact the UNT Student Help Desk: helpdesk@unt.edu or 940.565.2324 and obtain a ticket number. The instructor and the UNT Student Help Desk will work with the student to resolve any issues at the earliest possible time.

Examination Policy
There will be 3 exams in this class, including the final exam. You will be responsible for lecture, textbook, and primary source material for each exam. A review sheet with several essay possibilities will be handed out one week before each exam. The format of major tests and the final examination will be discussed in detail in review sessions before each is given.
Makeup Exams: In order to make up a quiz or exam, you must provide valid documentation for why you could not complete it on the assigned day. If allowed, students have 3 calendar days to make up the exam or they get a zero for that test score. The makeup exams may be different in structure and content than the regularly scheduled exams.
Instructor Responsibilities and Feedback:
1.For my part in this course, I am here to facilitate a deeper level in understanding American history and to help you spark a personal relevance to history in general. To accomplish this, I work to provide clear instructions on assignments but also stress the significance of why we have these assignments. I also make myself available for any student questions or concerns throughout the course. I regularly review and update my course content as historical study is a living organism that is constantly changing. Additionally, I try to identify resources and encourage students to further study the subject of this course after it ends.
2.I reply to student emails as soon as I can, mostly within a 24-hour period.
3.Students can expect grades and feedback on assignments no later than 1 week after it is due.
 
Late Work 
Students are strongly encouraged to get in touch with me BEFORE an assignment is due if they know they’re going to miss it. As long as you communicate with me, I am willing to work with you depending on the circumstances.

Attendance Policy
Though this course is all online, it’s important to make you aware that your success in your courses will directly correlate with your engagement, which includes attendance for in-person courses. Challenge yourself to engage in all course components to get the education you deserve.

Class Participation
A vital element of every class will be discussion and participation. Healthy discussion is only possible if everyone keeps up with the reading assignments. It is also expected that you give your undivided attention and support to your classmates during discussions. You can learn a great deal from listening to others. Conversations that take place in this class, or topics that we discuss may be uncomfortable to some. My hope is that you will approach this course with a sense of intellectual wonder and adventure. In this way, perhaps this course will expand what you know and understand about U.S. history. Please keep in mind that academic investigation need not be either stodgy, boring, tiresome, or dull. This requires, however, that you take as much responsibility for your own education as I do in creating an environment where learning can occur for everyone. The class will be as enlightening and exciting as you help make it. I approach this work as a mutual exchange of ideas, theories, hypotheses, and propositions about how history works in contemporary U.S. society. I am not here to merely to feed you information just as you are not here to accept all that I say without thinking critically.

Syllabus Change Policy
This syllabus is subject to change at the professor’s discretion. However, any changes I make will not be substantial, and I will communicate fully with you and give you ample time to prepare.

UNT Policies

Academic Integrity Policy
Academic Integrity Standards and Consequences. According to UNT Policy 06.003, Student Academic Integrity, academic dishonesty occurs when students engage in behaviors including, but not limited to cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, forgery, plagiarism, and sabotage. A finding of academic dishonesty may result in a range of academic penalties or sanctions ranging from admonition to expulsion from the University. If you are found to have plagiarized, cheated on an exam, or assisted someone else in cheating, you will receive a zero on the assignment.
(See: http://www.historians.org/pubs/free/professionalstandards.cfm#Plagiarism). More information on academic integrity can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog.
AI: Work undertaken outside of class will be submitted electronically via Canvas. All written work will be run through the plagiarism software Turnitin.com, which now contains detections of AI-generated content. Any content that is not original will be granted a grade of zero and may run the risk of being turned into The Office of the Provost for Student Success.
ADA Policy
UNT makes reasonable academic accommodation for students with disabilities. Students seeking accommodation must first register with the Office of Disability Accommodation (ODA) to verify their eligibility. If a disability is verified, the ODA will provide a student with an accommodation letter to be delivered to faculty to begin a private discussion regarding one’s specific course needs. Students may request accommodations at any time, however, ODA notices of accommodation should be provided as early as possible in the semester to avoid any delay in implementation. Note that students must obtain a new letter of accommodation for every semester and must meet with each faculty member prior to implementation in each class. For additional information see the ODA website https://disability.unt.edu/ ().
Prohibition of Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation (Policy 16.004)
The University of North Texas (UNT) prohibits discrimination and harassment because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law in its application and admission processes; educational programs and activities; employment policies, procedures, and processes; and university facilities. The University takes active measures to prevent such conduct and investigates and takes remedial action when appropriate.

Emergency Notification & Procedures
UNT uses a system called Eagle Alert to quickly notify students with critical information in the event of an emergency (i.e., severe weather, campus closing, and health and public safety emergencies like chemical spills, fires, or violence). In the event of a university closure, please refer to Canvas for contingency plans for covering course materials.
Retention of Student Records
Student records pertaining to this course are maintained in a secure location by the instructor of record. All records such as exams, answer sheets (with keys), and written papers submitted during the duration of the course are kept for at least one calendar year after course completion. Course work completed via the Canvas online system, including grading information and comments, is also stored in a safe electronic environment for one year. Students have the right to view their individual record; however, information about student’s records will not be divulged to other individuals without proper written consent. Students are encouraged to review the Public Information Policy and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) laws and the University’s policy. See UNT Policy 10.10, Records Management and Retention for additional information.
Acceptable Student Behavior
Student behavior that interferes with an instructor’s ability to conduct a class or other students' opportunity to learn is unacceptable and disruptive and will not be tolerated in any instructional forum at UNT. Students engaging in unacceptable behavior will be directed to leave the classroom and the instructor may refer the student to the Dean of Students to consider whether the student's conduct violated the Code of Student Conduct. The University's expectations for student conduct apply to all instructional forums, including University and electronic classroom, labs, discussion groups, field trips, etc. Visit UNT’s Code of Student Conduct (https://deanofstudents.unt.edu/conduct) to learn more.
Access to Information - Eagle Connect

For more information, please visit the website that explains Eagle Connect and how to forward e-mail Eagle Connect (https://it.unt.edu/eagleconnect).
Student Evaluation Administration Dates
Student feedback is important and an essential part of participation in this course. The student evaluation of instruction is a requirement for all organized classes at UNT. Students will receive an email from "UNT SPOT Course Evaluations via IASystem Notification" (no-reply@iasystem.org) with the survey link. Students should look for the email in their UNT email inbox. Simply click on the link and complete the survey. Once students complete the survey they will receive a confirmation email that the survey has been submitted. For additional information, please visit the SPOT website (http://spot.unt.edu/) or email spot@unt.edu.
Sexual Assault Prevention
UNT is committed to providing a safe learning environment free of all forms of sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Federal laws (Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act) and UNT policies prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and therefore prohibit sexual misconduct. If you or someone you know is experiencing sexual harassment, relationship violence, stalking, and/or sexual assault, there are campus resources available to provide support and assistance. UNT’s Survivor Advocates can assist a student who has been impacted by violence by filing protective orders, completing crime victim’s compensation applications, contacting professors for absences related to an assault, working with housing to facilitate a room change where appropriate, and connecting students to other resources available both on and off campus. The Survivor Advocates can be reached at SurvivorAdvocate@unt.edu or by calling the Dean of Students Office at 940-565- 2648. Additionally, alleged sexual misconduct can be non-confidentially reported to the Title IX Coordinator at oeo@unt.edu or at (940) 565 2759.
Important Notice for F-1 Students taking Distance Education Courses
Federal Regulation
To read detailed Immigration and Customs Enforcement regulations for F-1 students taking online courses, please go to the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations website (http://www.ecfr.gov/). The specific portion concerning distance education courses is located at Title 8 CFR 214.2 Paragraph (f)(6)(i)(G).
The paragraph reads:
(G) For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1 student's course of study is in a language study program, no on-line or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a student's full course of study requirement.
University of North Texas Compliance 
To comply with immigration regulations, an F-1 visa holder within the United States may need to engage in an on-campus experiential component for this course. This component (which must be approved in advance by the instructor) can include activities such as taking an on-campus exam, participating in an on-campus lecture or lab activity, or other on-campus experience integral to the completion of this course.
If such an on-campus activity is required, it is the student’s responsibility to do the following:
(1) Submit a written request to the instructor for an on-campus experiential component within one week of the start of the course.
(2) Ensure that the activity on campus takes place and the instructor documents it in writing with a notice sent to the International Student and Scholar Services Office.  ISSS has a form available that you may use for this purpose.
Because the decision may have serious immigration consequences, if an F-1 student is unsure about his or her need to participate in an on-campus experiential component for this course, s/he should contact the UNT International Student and Scholar Services Office (telephone 940-565-2195 or email internationaladvising@unt.edu) to get clarification before the one-week deadline.

Student Verification
UNT takes measures to protect the integrity of educational credentials awarded to students enrolled in distance education courses by verifying student identity, protecting student privacy, and notifying students of any special meeting times/locations or additional charges associated with student identity verification in distance education courses.
See UNT Policy 07-002 Student Identity Verification, Privacy, and Notification and Distance Education Courses (https://policy.unt.edu/policy/07-002).

1.The work is used only once.
2.The work is not used in its entirety.
3.Use of the work does not affect any potential profits from the work.
4.The student is not identified.
5.The work is identified as student work.

Download the UNT System Permission, Waiver and Release Form
Transmission and Recording of Student Images in Electronically-Delivered Courses
1.No permission is needed from a student for his or her image or voice to be transmitted live via videoconference or streaming media, but all students should be informed when courses are to be conducted using either method of delivery.
2.In the event an instructor records student presentations, he or she must obtain permission from the student using a signed release in order to use the recording for future classes in accordance with the Use of Student-Created Work guidelines above.
3.Instructors who video-record their class lectures with the intention of re-using some or all of recordings for future class offerings must notify students on the course syllabus if students' images may appear on video. Instructors are also advised to provide accommodation for students who do not wish to appear in class recordings.
Example: This course employs lecture capture technology to record class sessions. Students may occasionally appear on video. The lecture recordings will be available to you for study purposes and may also be reused in future course offerings.
No notification is needed if only audio and slide capture is used or if the video only records the instructor's image. However, the instructor is encouraged to let students know the recordings will be available to them for study purposes.

##Example 2: HIST 3160:

HIST 3160: 20th Century Latinx Civil Rights Movements
Spring 2025 Class Location: WH 321
Class Days: Monday/Wednesday/Friday, 3pm to 3:50pm

Instructor: Dr. Manny A. Grajales
Office Location: Wooten Hall, 241
Office Hours: Monday/Wednesday, 10:30am-11:30am; 1:30pm-2:30pm; By Appointment
Instructor’s University Email: Manuel.Grajales@unt.edu

Course Description:
We will explore the major events, figures, and ideas in Latinx Civil Rights history. This course will identify how Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Central Americans individually and organizationally demanded citizenship and civil rights throughout the 20th century. The class will pay close attention to how movements deployed community collective action to demand social and political change along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, labor rights, economic equality, im/migration, and popular culture. These areas are vital to understanding the shift in Latinx identity, culture, and politics. Moreover, we will look at how Latinx Civil Rights worked in relation to other civil rights movements and identify the objectives that led to solidarity, compromise, or conflict with other social movements.

Required Text(s):
+There is no required textbook or books for the course. Assigned materials that build our weekly discussions will be available on Canvas or accessible through UNT Libraries.
Course materials that examine the major themes of the course include the following: Primary source documents (newspapers, letters, journal entries, etc.); Oral interviews with figures from the past; academic articles; popular journals; podcasts; documentaries; videos that discuss issues from the past still discussed today.
I have also included supplementary articles available for you all to use on your own time. They are listed as “Additional Materials” in the modules section of Canvas.

Student Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:
1. Interpret basic knowledge of the history of Latinx Civil Rights Movements in the United States from at least the 1900s to the present-day using primary and secondary source material
2. Explain race relations, issues of identity, and gender dynamics within Latinx populations in the United States.
3. Reflect on the long struggle for Latinx inclusion and its effect on democracy in the United States.
4. Identify major personalities, key events, and historical processes related to Latinx populations.

Course Expectations:
Attendance: Because we will be discussing a lot of important content in class, it is vital for students to attend class. I understand that commitments outside of this class may cause conflicts or personal wellbeing will need to be prioritized. For that, please contact me immediately so I know what is going on and we can plan accordingly. Additionally, you are allowed three unexcused absences (one that you have not discussed with me the issue or it’s a universityexcused absence) during the semester. A class roster will be read at the beginning of each class, or a class roll will be passed around. If you’re walking late to class, be sure and remind the instructor at the end of class that you are in attendance. Otherwise, you may not receive attendance credit.
Your Expectations in Class: The attached class schedule lists weekly reading assignments, which you should complete before the first lecture of that week. Whether or not you can complete reading assignments before I deliver the corresponding lectures, I do expect you to keep up with the readings. Your grade depends in part upon your ability to participate meaningfully in discussions. The practice of history is about making and supporting arguments, but I do expect you to remain civil and respect the opinions of your classmates during these dialogues. 

Structure of class during the week: We will dedicate Mondays and Wednesdays to lectures and informal discussions about the focus of the week and any questions you have. For the weekly readings or materials in the syllabus, have them read before the start of the week.
Fridays will be dedicated to class discussion about the Friday material I have assigned. These could include primary documents, a documentary, a news video, an oral interview with a veteran or civil rights activist, etc. Make sure to be ready to contribute to these discussions for Friday's class. I will go over how Fridays will go during the first week of classes.

Course & Assignment Requirements:

1.Participation (Total points: 15%)
Your participation in class is also vital to the course. This course is highly collaborative and participatory. It is imperative that you attend (if healthy), and that you are ready to contribute to discussions to nurture both personal and communal growth in the class.
This can range from comments about the materials or asking questions about a reading or theme. Additionally, there may be times where I ask you all to break up into small groups and work together. Participation may also include actively submitting all assignments in a timely manner.
If you are uncomfortable speaking in class, I will provide alternatives that allow you to earn the participation grade. Just showing up to sleep, listen to a podcast, or watch a Twitch stream while the rest of the class engages will not earn you participation points.
2.Reading Reflection Assignments (35%)
Throughout the semester, you will be responsible for seven reflection pieces. The first assignment of the course, due during the middle of week 2, in 300-500 words, tell me a little about your journey to college, your major, what histories do you find interesting, and what you know about the themes/histories we will discuss in our course.
Five of the reflections, in 500 or more words, you will critically engage with the readings, lectures, or other materials from the course. I also want this to be a creative outlet, which allows you to use images to connect your points. You can choose to analyze and engage a specific theme in an article or address questions that you had about the material.
The final reflection, due during finals week, will be a self-reflection of your journey within the course and how it has shaped your understanding of Latinx Civil Rights History. 
More directions on word count, citations, format, etc. will be available on Canvas and discussed 
during the first week of class.

3.Midterm: Latinx Civil Rights and Oral Histories (10%)
During week 7, you all will choose an oral history interview or interview synopsis from either the VOCES Oral History Project or Bracero History Archive to discuss on Friday. At the end of week 8 you will answer the prompt questions provided in Canvas in 1000 words or more. More information on the midterm will be available on Canvas and discussed during the first week of the semester.

4.Major Project: Commemorating Latinx Civil Rights (20%)
The proposal will be worth 5%
The final project is worth 15% and will be three components (bibliography and chart, Reflection essay, chart, final product).
Commemorating Latinx Civil Rights Project allows students to incorporate the topics we are learning throughout the semester into a creative project. Breakdown of the project:
    By week 5, you will submit a proposal to be stating what topic you are researching, what type of non-essay project you are doing, your preliminary source base, and reasons for choosing the topic and medium.
    After submitting your proposal, the final project will have the following components:
       1.Full Bibliography (Chicago/Turabian. If you are a non-history major you can use MLA or APA but must ask my permission)
       2.Reflection essay (600-750 words in which you describe the intent behind your publichistory project, what you learned while researching it, and your self-evaluation of how well you succeeded in creating it.
       3.Chart that accounts for time put into the project.
       4.The Final product.
      More details about the project will be available on Canvas


5.Final Project: Research Paper (20%)
You will submit a final paper at the end of the semester (due day of our course’s scheduled finals). Focusing the paper on the focus of your un-essay project, you will develop a research based argumentative essay that is 2100 to 2400 words (7 to 8 pages roughly). Citation style is negotiable based on what discipline you are coming from, but History Majors will use Chicago/Turabian. The paper itself is worth 15%.
During Weeks 14 and Week 15, you will give a 7-to-9-minute presentation about their project theme to the class. This will be worth 5% of the final grade of your paper. 
More information on this will be provided on Canvas and during the first week of class.


Grading
Grades for the semester will be determined according to the following breakdown. There will not be extra credit opportunities in class. Grades will be tabulated in Canvas for you:
The grading scale used for this course is as follows:
720-800 A

Course Expectations
The following are the basic expectations for success in this course.
• Come to class prepared. You must keep up with the assignments to perform well in this course. Do not hesitate to ask questions during lecture or after class.
• All assignments must be completed on the scheduled due date, unless the student provides a valid, documented excuse. Absence on exam days will only be excused with appropriate documentation (e.g., doctor’s note, letter from coach/Academic Advisor).
• All assignments can be discussed with the instructor by email or in person during office hours.
• To pass this class, all assignments must be completed! No Exceptions!
*NOTE on grading protocol for Written assignments: After I return written assignments to you, there is a mandatory 24-hour reflection period before requesting a meeting. This allows you to read through and understand the comments made. 

Attendance Policy: Your attendance and attention in class is expected. I follow the universitypolicy regarding absences and will discuss this further on the first day. Appointments to see me regarding absences should be done outside of class, whether in person or through email. Please be aware of important dates on the Academic Calendar: Q-drop, Holidays/Reading Days, and final exam schedule.

Late Work Policy: I understand life happens: Work, family, other assignments, the realization that an assignment might have needed more time, etc. If you reach a point where you are freaking out about a deadline and the options that pop into your head include a sleepless night to finish (which might not be your best work), not submitting anything, or plagiarizing, I’d rather you turn the assignment in late than get a zero. Having said that, all assignments have a 12-hour grace period after the set due date to still be submitted and counted as on-time. If you require an extension to submit the assignment late, email me and we can discuss the timeline and any late penalty that will be attached (if applicable). I ask that you let me know about the need for an extension well in advance of the due date. However, I do understand that emergencies happen and will take that into account.

Communication with Instructor: Students are encouraged to contact me with any issues you might have. Beyond the classroom, the best way to get in touch with me is through email and office hours. Office hours are designated times for you, the student. Please come to talk to me about any concerns or issues that arise during the semester. If you are struggling with the class, you need to talk out an idea about your paper, or need to talk about something, the times listed or 
making an appointment are the best way. Any discussion of grades must be done in person during office hours, as FERPA protocol dictates grades cannot be discussed over email. I will usually answer within 24 to 48 hours. Questions that can be found on the syllabus will receive lower response priority. Most importantly, letting me know your concerns early allows us to find a solution to the problem instead of you coming in at Week 13 when options are 
limited. If you’re struggling, reach out! I want you to succeed!
Withdrawal Policy: If you are unable to complete the course, you must withdraw by the 12thUniversity class day for a refund. A student wishing to withdraw from a course before the end of the semester must initiate the process by filling out the official withdrawal form, which can be found on the University’s website or at the Registrar’s office.
Academic Integrity Standards and Consequences. The University of North Texas promotes the integrity of learning and embraces the core values of trust and honesty. Academic integrity is based on educational principles and procedures that protect the rights of all participants in the educational process and validate the legitimacy of degrees awarded by the University. In the investigation and resolution of allegations of student academic dishonesty, the University’s 
actions are intended to be corrective, educationally sound, fundamentally fair, and based on reliable evidence. Students should be aware that “acts of dishonesty” include cheating, plagiarism, furnishing misleading information, and forgery. We will uphold the policies and 
regulations of the University.
(See: http://www.historians.org/pubs/free/professionalstandards.cfm#Plagiarism Links to an external site.)
If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism while you are in the process of writing your final paper, see me. More information on academic integrity can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog.

Course-Related Academic Adjustments with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
The University of North Texas makes reasonable academic reasonable accommodation for students with disabilities. Students seeking reasonable accommodation must first register with the Office of Disability Accommodation (ODA) to verify their eligibility. If a disability is verified, the ODA will provide you with a reasonable accommodation letter to be delivered to faculty to begin a private discussion regarding your specific needs in a course. You may request 
reasonable accommodation at any time, however, ODA notices of reasonable accommodation should be provided as early as possible in the semester to avoid any delay in implementation. Note that students must obtain a new letter of reasonable accommodation for every semester and must meet with each faculty member prior to implementation in each class. Students are strongly encouraged to deliver letters of reasonable accommodation during faculty office hours or by 
appointment. Faculty members have the authority to ask students to discuss such letters during their designated office hours to protect the privacy of the student. For additional information see the Office of Disability Accommodation website at http://www.unt.edu/oda. You may also contact them by phone at 940.565.4323.

Course Information: 
World War II: European Theatre, 4070
Instructor: Dr. Vojin Majstorovic

Course Description: 
A survey of the European experience of World War II, the defining conflict in modern history that continues to cast its long shadow even into the 21st century. How did Germany, defeated in World War I, vanquish much of Europe only twenty years later?  How did the Soviet Union, after losing millions of troops and its most important territories, manage to come back from the brink and completely reverse the German gains? Did the Axis have any chance of winning after the USA entered the war, with its vast industrial and human resources? How did the Americans and British plan and execute the largest sea-born invasion in history? How did millions of European civilians experience the war – including the Holocaust, bombings, combat, and various military occupations? What was the legacy of the war for postwar European society and international relations? 

In this course, we will answer these questions by looking at the military, diplomatic, political, and social history of the war.

One of your sources must be a scholarly monograph (a single-author book published by academic press). The remaining two sources can be a combination of academic monographs, memoirs, primary document collection (including interviews), films, or novels. You may use more than one academic monograph, but you should use only one of each type of source (one memoir, one film, etc.) There will be a 30% deduction if you do not use the correct sources. Speak to me if you are not sure about your sources. You cannot use any of the required readings as your sources. The term paper will not be accepted after November 30 at 23.59.

Attendance 
Attendance and participation are worth 15% of the final grade. Students are allowed to miss three classes without the instructor’s approval or a medical note. After three unexcused absences, students will begin to lose marks. It should be noted that attendance is not enough to get full 15%, engagement and participation in discussions is expected.   

The instructor will try to record all lectures, but sometimes he may forget to do so or there may be technical difficulties. The instructor is not obliged to record lectures, but will try to do so to make lives easier for students. 

Class Recordings
Class recordings – when and if I do make them – are the intellectual property of the instructor and are reserved for use only by students in this class and only for educational purposes. Students may not post or otherwise share the recordings outside the class, or outside the Canvas Learning Management System, in any form. Failing to follow this restriction is a violation of the UNT Code of Student Conduct and could lead to disciplinary action.

Equipment that Students Need
To successfully participate in this course, students will need to have access to a reliable Internet connection.

Laptops and Cell Phones: 
Laptops must only be used for taking notes, but the connection to the Internet must be turned off. Anyone observed using their computer for purposes other than note-taking (messaging, surfing the Internet even if related to the course) will not be permitted to use their laptop for the duration of the course. Also, please ensure that cell phones are turned off and put away before you enter the classroom. Smartphones cannot be used in class for any purpose and must be kept off the tables. Students are not allowed to record lectures without the instructor’s permission. 

Academic Integrity:
According to UNT Policy 06.003, Student Academic Integrity, academic dishonesty occurs when students engage in behaviors including, but not limited to cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, forgery, and plagiarism. A finding of academic dishonesty may result in a range of academic penalties or sanctions ranging from admonition to expulsion from the University. 

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate texts or rephrase existing texts is considered cheating. Similarly, the use of use AI tools, such as Grammarly, which correct grammar, punctuation, and can rephrase texts is not permitted. Students who use AI will receive a 0 on the assignment for the first offense and the instructor will file Academic Integrity Violation Report. The penalty for a second violation is to receive an “F” in the class, while another Academic Integrity Violation Report will be filed.

Accommodation Statement:
UNT makes reasonable academic accommodation for students with disabilities. Students seeking accommodation must first register with the Office of Disability Accommodation (ODA) to verify their eligibility. If a disability is verified, the ODA will provide a student with an accommodation letter to be delivered to faculty to begin a private discussion regarding one’s specific course needs. Students may request accommodations at any time, however, ODA notices of accommodation should be provided as early as possible in the semester to avoid any delay in implementation. Note that students must obtain a new letter of accommodation for every semester and must meet with each faculty member prior to implementation in each class. For additional information see the ODA website at disability.unt.edu.

Emergency Notification & Procedures:
UNT uses a system called Eagle Alert to quickly notify students with critical information in the event of an emergency (i.e., severe weather, campus closing, and health and public safety emergencies like chemical spills, fires, or violence). In the event of a university closure, please refer to Canvas for contingency plans for covering course materials.

Office Hours: Tuesdays 2:30-3:30 PM (WH264) on Tuesdays; or by appointment

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Often when studying the histories of nations we highlight the eventful incidents (like wars, riots, etc.) and consequently overlook the everyday hidden within those eventful incidents and beyond. This course will explore how modern Britain as a country and as a society was shaped through both events and everyday histories. Thus, giving equal importance to the major events as well as people’s everyday experiences in the nation’s history. In the process, it will study how Britain's identity (political, social and cultural) was shaped over two hundred years. The course will cover themes like (but not limited to): Industrial revolution, the Victorian Era, the Great War, immigration, morality, health, welfare, including the recent events of Brexit, a new monarch and more.
Note: This is NOT a course on queens and kings (yes, we will NOT be discussing Harry, Megan, William or Kate)- but focuses on the everyday histories of people like you and me!

COURSE OBJECTIVES:
1. Understand the key events, and themes in modern British History.
2. Access a range of sources, of information, primary and secondary, relevant to British history of 
this period and present the results.
3. Exercise a critical understanding of primary sources, secondary sources and historical 
methodologies.
4. Think analytically and communicate complex ideas and arguments using a variety of methods, 
skills, which can be transferred to other areas of study and employment.

MATERIALS FOR CLASS:
• READINGS: No textbooks will be used for this course. All readings will be uploaded on 
Canvas or available via e-resources from the Library
• MOVIES: Most movies are optional, and some will be screened in class (partly). 
However, there will be some movies that you will be expected to watch before class – by 
renting/borrowing/watching online

• Syllabus Quiz: 5 points
• Intro Essay: 5 points
• Concluding Review Essay: 10 points
• Class participation (includes class discussions, primary source analysis, online Thursday online source discussion submissions -when indicated so): (10 points each week- except Mid-terms and Finals week) 140 points
• Mid-term: Public History project: 150 points: By week 6-7, you'll pick a historical topic that interests you, research it using scholarly sources, and create a thoughtful, informative, and interesting summation of your findings that is meant for the general public. This project can potentially take a lot of different forms: a website, a podcast, a game, a newspaper article, a letter to the editor, a Twitter thread, etc. You are encouraged to be creative. You will also separately submit a bibliography of the scholarly sources you consulted and a reflection essay (500-750 words) in which you describe the intent behind your publichistory project, what you learned while researching it, and your self-evaluation of how well you succeeded in creating it. More information on this assignment will be provided to you in the beginning of the semester
• Draft final essay presentation: 50 points. You must have a PowerPoint for this. You will be evaluated on your presentation skills, arguments, use of sources (primary and secondary)
• Final Essay: 300 points
You will be given a prompt for your final essay and you will write a traditional research essay of around 2000 words. You will turn these in electronically via Canvas, and detailed instructions are on Canvas. If you need help with your writing, feel free to contact the Writing center or come to me for assistance.

ETIQUETTE AND NETIQUETTE:
In this class, we will be engaging with each other in two ways: in person while we are in class, and via online communication using the discussion boards on Canvas. It is important that everyone be aware of in-person etiquette and online etiquette – known as ‘Netiquette’ – and treat each other with mutual respect. A helpful site for understanding appropriate online communication is Albion’s “The Core Rules of Netiquette”: http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html Thank you in advance for using respectful and mature in-person and online communication skills

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STANDARDS AND CONSEQUENCES:
According to UNT Policy 06.003, Student Academic Integrity, academic dishonesty occurs when students engage in behaviors including, but not limited to cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, forgery, plagiarism, and sabotage. A finding of academic dishonesty may result in a range of academic penalties or sanctions ranging from admonition to expulsion from the University.
In this course, all work must be original to each student and may not be completed in pairs or groups. Doing so may warrant a zero grade for that assignment. Wikipedia, cliffs notes, sparks notes, blogs, and online encyclopedias are not appropriate sources and should not be consulted when completing any assignments. Doing so may warrant a zero grade. Evidence of unoriginal work will result in failing the assignment. All appropriate sources (primary and secondary) should 
be cited in footnotes. Typical university protocol on plagiarism, as stated on the UNT Academic Integrity website (http://facultysuccess.unt.edu/academic-integrity), will be enforced.
Course materials may not be distributed or posted online without the express written consent of the instructor. All students who wish to use recording devices must sign a statement agreeing not to post, distribute, or circulate any part of the lectures. A failure to do so constitutes a theft of intellectual property and may warrant dismissal from the course, an “F” grade, and appropriate UNT disciplinary action.

RESPECT AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT:
Students are expected to treat one another, the course, and professor with the respect of a workplace. On time arrival, staying on topic, and avoiding distracting behaviors helps to maintain a stable working environment for your classmates. Bullying or aggressive behavior will not be tolerated. Please silence all electronic devices and avoid non-academic discussions during class time. Students may not use cell phones in class.
Student behavior that interferes with an instructor’s ability to conduct a class or other students’opportunity to learn is unacceptable and disruptive and will not be tolerated in any instructional forum at UNT. Students engaging in unacceptable behavior will be directed to leave the classroom and the instructor may refer the student to the Dean of Students to consider whether the student's conduct violated the Code of Student Conduct. The Code of Student Conduct can be found at www.deanofstudents.unt.eduTutoring and Study Sessions
For tips about strengthening your study skills, writing ability, and time management, or for coordinating study sessions and meeting tutors, please feel free to contact UNT’s learning center.  https://learningcenter.unt.edu/

ADA ACCOMMODATION STATEMENT:
UNT makes reasonable academic accommodation for students with disabilities. Students seeking accommodation must first register with the Office of Disability Access (ODA) to verify their eligibility. If a disability is verified, the ODA will provide a student with an accommodation letter to be delivered to faculty to begin a private discussion regarding one’s specific course needs. 
Students may request accommodations at any time, however, ODA notices of accommodation should be provided as early as possible in the semester to avoid any delay in implementation. Note that students must obtain a new letter of accommodation for every semester and must meet with each faculty member prior to implementation in each class. For additional information see the ODA website at disability.unt.edu.
If you are receiving accommodations from the ODA please make an appointment to meet with me, preferably within the first two weeks of the semester, so that we can ensure that all accommodations can and will be met appropriately in the course.

EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION & PROCEDURES:
UNT uses a system called Eagle Alert to quickly notify students with critical information in the event of an emergency (i.e., severe weather, campus closing, and health and public safety emergencies like chemical spills, fires, or violence). In the event of a university closure, please refer to Canvas for contingency plans for covering course materials.

###Example 5: HIST 4260:
HIST 4260.004: History and the Medical Humanities (HIST 4260.202: Honors Section)
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00-3:20pm Wooten Hall 115

Instructor: Dr. Jakob Burnham
Email: jakob.burnham@unt.edu
Office: Wooten Hall 242
Office Hours: Tuesdays, 5:00-7:30pm and by appointment (both in-Person and via zoom)

Course Description: This course will introduce students to the medical humanities—a growing field that uses the methods of humanistic inquiry to explore and challenge discourses of medicine, health, and medical science. Together we will question the relationship between medical and humanistic knowledge by examining the history of medicine, concepts of disease vs illness, narrative medicine, health disparities, religion, spirituality, and the role of science and technology on the practices of healthcare. What do we know about humans and human bodies? How do we know what we know? And how do we talk or write 
about this knowledge and its application? In the course, we will explore the dynamics between history, society, and the diverse components of medicine, while developing skills in close reading, interpretation, historical contextualization, and critical thinking.

Course Prerequisites: None
Course Goals: Engaged students who come to class regularly, participate actively in discussions, and complete all readings and written assignments, will improve their ability to:
1) comprehend different frameworks in the humanities that engage with medical issues.
2) learn multiple methods of research in the medical humanities.
3) compare theoretical approaches to medicine.
4) closely read and contextualize primary sources. 
5) develop visual and oral skills for communicating original research questions.

Course Format: This course meets twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays for 80 minutes. The course predominately consists of in-depth discussion of content, delivered via assigned readings and lectures.
E-mail and Office Hours: I try to answer email quickly during business hours (M-F, 9am – 5pm). I communicate frequently through email and Canvas. Many email questions can be answered by reading the syllabus or looking at Canvas, so please double check those places before you reach out—you might save yourself sometime! I welcome everyone to my office hours each week. These are times for you to“walk-in” and come to talk with us about any number of things—whether they be related to the course or other aspects of your University experience. The times are listed above for in-person but with Zoom it is 
often easier to just make an appointment. 

Course/Learning Environment: Every student in this class should have the right to learn and engage within an environment of respect and courtesy from others. We will discuss our classroom’s habits of engagement and I also encourage you to review UNT’s student code of conduct so that we can all start with the same baseline civility understanding (Code of Student Conduct). UNT strives to offer you a high quality education and a supportive environment, so you learn and grow. As a faculty member, I am committed to helping you be successful as a student.

Course Accommodations: The University of North Texas makes reasonable academic accommodation for students with disabilities. Students seeking reasonable accommodation must first register with the Office of Disability Access (ODA) to verify their eligibility. If a disability is verified, the ODA will provide you with a reasonable accommodation letter to be delivered to faculty to begin a private discussion regarding your specific needs in a course. You may request reasonable accommodations at any time; however, ODA notices of reasonable accommodation should be provided as early as possible in the semester to avoid any delay in implementation. Note that students must obtain a new letter of reasonable accommodation for every semester and must meet with each faculty member prior to implementation in each class. Students are strongly encouraged to deliver letters of reasonable accommodation during faculty office hours or by appointment. Faculty members have the authority to ask students to discuss such letters during their designated office hours to protect the privacy of the student. For
additional information, refer to the Office of Disability Access website (http://www.unt.edu/oda). You may also contact ODA by phone at (940) 565-4323.
Academic Integrity: The University of North Texas promotes the integrity of learning and embraces the core values of trust and honesty. Academic integrity is based on educational principles and procedures that protect the rights of all participants in the educational process and validate the legitimacy of degrees 
awarded by the University. In the investigation and resolution of allegations of student academic dishonesty, the University’s actions are intended to be corrective, educationally sound, fundamentally fair, and based on reliable evidence.

STUDENT   WELLNESS    STATEMENT    (with thanks to Professor Ryan Cordell for inspiration)
Much of our course and this syllabus has been adapted from previous semesters. I have tried to adapt it to support you in the face of the very real challenges that you-and all of us—are facing right now. However, I'm certain that I have not imagined every situation that might arise, or fully accounted for  the  full   range  or  extremity  of  situations  you   might  find  yourselves  in now. So   in   this   new, unprecedented  time  (remember  those  good  old "precedented" times? Those  were  nice...)I'll  rely  on your understanding and grace as we work together through this semester, and I'll extend that same understanding and grace to you.
Consider this statement a kind of override switch for literally everything else on the syllabus. I mean it, I promise -everything on this syllabus is subject to this one clause. We're all doing our best to learn together during an extremely difficult time. We're working in new ways and in unusual environments. We’re caring for others and trying to keep ourselves healthy, sheltered, fed, and sane. Some of us are dealing with fear and loss. Among all these challenges, I still want to come together and talk about the history  of "the book". In  addition  to  being  fascinating-given  this  world  we  find  ourselves  in, that history is even ...important. I know that we can learn a lot from each other and even have some fun together in the next few months. I will operate from the base assumption that each of you is here in good faith: that you are curious, engaged,and eager to do the best work you can.
Taking  all  that  as  given, I  also  want  you  to  know  that  your  health—both  physical  and  mental—is always more important to me than this class. Your family and friends' health is always more important to me than this class. You don't have to apologize to me if you work at a different pace from what’s outlined on this syllabus, or if we need to find an alternative path for you through this class. My primary role as a teacher is to support you however I can, in whatever ways that I can. Let me know how I can do  that  better. I  truly, truly  mean  all  of  this. I'm  here  for  you. Let's  support  each  other  through  the challenges and maybe even the joys of this strange semester. Let's do this.

Course Theme Question: How does technology influence the way we write and think?
Class  Description  [Short]
This seminar and hands-on workshop explores the influence of changing technologies of writing on the formation of world cultures up to the digital age.
Class  Description  [Long]
This  interdisciplinary  class  will  use  the  approaches  of  history, studio  art, and  art  history  to explore  the  influence  that  changing  technologies  of  writing—from  cave  paintings, to Gutenberg, to  digital  e-readers-had  on  the   intellectual, political, and  social  formation  of  world cultures. We will also question whether a similar  revolution  is  taking  place  in  the  digital  age. In  a  seminar format, we will  focus  on  major  developments  in  the  technologies  of  representation一 image-making, writing, printing-against   their   relevant    social   and    historical    backgrounds .In addition  to  seminar-style  discussions, practical  workshops  will  explore  the  physical  technologies of  the  written   and   printed  word   through  hands-on  paper-and  parchment-making, calligraphy   and illumination,woodcutting,engraving,etching,lithography,letterpress         printing, bookbinding, and  digital  publishing. The  course  will  culminate  in  a  final  book-making  project  that uses one or more of these technologies to explore the boundaries between the oral and written, manuscript   and   print, self  and "other".

Readings: The  texts  for  this  course  are

●    The Book History   Reader(Routledge,2006;second   edition, paperback),edited   by   David Finkelstein and Alistair McCleery.ISBN-13:978-0415359481
●    Erik Kwakkel, Books  Before  Print  (Leeds, ARC  Humanities  Press,2018).ISBN-13:
9781942401636.E-Book in  UNT  Library. Also available in paperback as  ISBN-13: 9781942401629
Both are available for  purchase  online, from the  UNT  Bookstore, and  for free  on  2-hour  reserve at the UNT Library. Several handouts and supplemental readings will also be made available in  class and online.

Student Learning Outcomes:
Students will be able to:
●  Demonstrate knowledge of major themes and events in the history of the book.
·     Consider and discuss definitions and meanings of the “history of the book”; its significance as an object of study; and the major historiographical themes of this subject.
·     Demonstrate a critical understanding of the changing technologies of writing, and the impact that these changes have had on cultural, intellectual, and political history.
●  Construct fact-based argument and present them both orally and in writing.
●  Produce a creative material response to the course theme question that utilizes the technologies and techniques of the written and printed word encountered in the class.

Teaching Philosophy
In my teaching, I seek to help students to connect their enthusiasm and curiosity for a particular time and place to an exploration of broader historical issues, as they learn to build coherent arguments that are well supported by evidence. I make use of three main methods to reach this fundamental  goal:1)a  focus  on  intensive  discussion  and  cumulative  writing  projects  that  foster   critical  thinking;2)the  utilization  of  a   multidisciplinary  approach  that  engages  students  through a variety  of  interpretive  perspectives; and  3)an  emphasis  on  working  with  primary  sources  and  making  informed  use  of the  latest  technological  resources,drawing  especially  upon  the  Digital Humanities. My  three  main  teaching  methods  together  underpin  my  fundamental  goal  in  the classroom: to encourage students to combine an excitement about the  past with  a  broad historical  understanding  and the  ability to  make  and  evaluate  arguments.

Rules  of  Engagement
Rules of engagement refer to the way students are expected to interact with each other and with their instructors. Here are some general guidelines for our class:
·     Protect your health and that of our classroom community-DO  NOT COME TO CLASS  if you feel unwell or have symptoms of any kind. You won't be penalized, and you will be able to   access anything you need remotely or through a contactless pick-up of materials.
·     While the freedom to express yourself is a fundamental human right, any communication that utilizes cruel and derogatory language on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual   orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law will not  be  tolerated.
·     Treat your instructor and classmates with respect in any communication, even when their opinion differs from your own.
●  Ask for and use the correct name and pronouns for your instructor and classmates.
·     Speak  from  personal  experiences. Use "I" statements to share thoughts and feelings. Try  not to speak on behalf of groups or other individual's experiences.
·     Use your critical thinking skills to challenge other people's ideas, instead of attacking individuals.
●  Avoid using all caps while communicating digitally. This may be interpreted as "YELLING!”
·      Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm in emails or discussion posts as tone can be difficult to  interpret  digitally.
Proofread and fact-check your sources.
●  Keep in mind that online posts can be permanent, so think first before you type.

syllabus are listed on the day for which they are due. Please bring the assigned readings to class with you each day, along with your answers to the class-prep online discussion  questions. However, if you are unable to come to class due to illness(be sure to stay home if you are ill!)or another conflict, please contact me, and we can discuss ways that   you can still earn participation credit.
Whether online or in class, however, quality participation also means interacting with your peers in a critical yet positive manner-knowing how to disagree courteously is a valuable skill, as is learning how to acknowledge the validity of someone else's point.(I encourage everyone   to refer to evidence in the source material as often as possible during our discussions.)


3.Two Journals -10 pts per entry (Total   Points:130)
●  ON EVEN WEEKS :a handwritten journal on paper(one entry per week,due at the beginning of each class by uploading a digital image of your handwritten journal to the CANVAS Discussion Forum for that Week)

We will be recording our reactions to the course readings, ideas, and discussions in two different   formats over the course of the semester to see if the different media cause us to think in different ways.
Use both your handwritten journal and your Blog posts to gather anything related to the course that you find  interesting—images, sketches, quotes, bits of information, your  reactions, thoughts, etc.   You can doodle, write prose, link to music, video, etc.—anything you find helpful.The blog is an especially good place to gather ideas related to your final creative project and your research paper. While handwritten journals are usually private (and here only seen by other members of our class), the blog is a different, public way of taking notes (seen by anyone with the internet link).You might be surprised at the interaction between your two ways of keeping track of inspiration.

FORA  GRADE:
·     Make a minimum of one entry per week in the required journaling format, due each Monday by the beginning of class time (the blog is posted online; a digital image of your handwritten journal is posted to the online CANVAS Discussion Forum page for our class by the beginning of class time).

1.a  response  in  word  or  image  (sketch, doodle, paste-in, etc.)to  the  reading  for  the week, UPLOADED AS A DIGITAL IMAGE to our CANVAS Page
■  If your response is an image, you must also describe in words how your image relates to the course readings.
■ If you responded in words, your response must be at least a paragraph long.

·     The blog entry must  have:
1.A title in the following format: COURSE POST WEEK#:SOME SNAPPY TITLE HERE
2.Each  blog  post  must  consist  of:
■  one or more images
■  either a link or a quote relating to or commenting on the image(s)
■  a text box in which you make clear the connection(s)to the course readings

Your journal post can be made in response to someone else's post, but you can't repost an image from the entry of someone else who is in the class.(You have to find your own images.)

We will share both our handwritten and blog journal entries throughout the semester and discuss some of the most engaging or thought-provoking as a group.

Sexual  Assault  Prevention
UNT is committed to providing a safe learning environment free of all forms of sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment sexual assault, domestic violence,dating violence, and stalking. Federal laws(Title IX and the Violence Against Women Act)and UNT policies prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and therefore prohibit sexual misconduct.

UNT's Survivor Advocates can assist a student who has been impacted by violence by filing protective orders, completing crime victim's compensation applications, contacting professors for absences related to an assault, working with housing to facilitate a room change where appropriate, and connecting students to other resources available both on and off campus. The Survivor Advocates can be reached at SurvivorAdvocate@unt.edu  or by calling the Dean of Students Office at 940-565-2648.Additionally,alleged sexual misconduct can be non-confidentially reported to the Title IX Coordinator at oeo@unt.edu  or  at(940)5652759.
Important   Notice   for    F-1   Students    taking   Distance    Education   Courses
Federal Regulation
To read detailed Immigration and Customs Enforcement regulations for F-1 students taking online courses, please go to the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations website     (http://www.ecfr.gov/).The specific portion concerning distance education courses is located at Title 8 CFR 214.2 Paragraph (f)(6)(i)(G).
The paragraph reads:
(G)For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent off one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or distance education course is a course that is offered principally
through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit,  cable, microwave, or  satellite, audio  conferencing, or  computer  conferencing. If  the  F-1  student's  course of study is in a language study program, no on-line or distance education classes may be considered to    count toward a student's full course of study requirement.

University of North Texas Compliance
To comply with immigration regulations, an F-1 visa holder within the United States may need to engage in an on-campus experiential component for this course. This component(which must be approved in advance by the instructor)can include activities such as taking an on-campus exam, participating in an on-campus lecture or lab activity, or other on-campus experience integral to the completion of this Course.
If such an on-campus activity is required, it is the student’s responsibility to do the following:
(1)Submit a written request to the instructor for an on-campus experiential component within one week of the start of the course.
(2)Ensure that the activity on campus takes place and the instructor documents it in writing with a
notice sent to the International Student and Scholar Services Office. ISSS has a form available that you may use for this purpose.
Because the decision may have serious immigration consequences, if an F-1 student is unsure about his or her need to participate in an on-campus experiential component for this course, s/he should contact the UNT International Student and Scholar Services Office (telephone 940-565-2195 oremail
internationaladvising@unt.edu)   to get  clarification before the one-week deadline.
Student  Verification
UNT takes measures to protect the integrity of educational credentials awarded to students enrolled in distance education courses  by verifying student  identity, protecting student  privacy, and  notifying students of any special meeting times/locations or additional charges associated with student identity verification in distance education courses.
See UNT Policy 07-002 Student Identity Verification, Privacy, and Notification and Distance Education Courses(https://policy.unt.edu/policy/07-002).

Download the UNT System Permission, Waiver and Release Form

Transmission and Recording of Student Images in Electronically-Delivered Courses
1.No permission is needed from a student for his or her image or voice to be transmitted live via videoconference or streaming media, but all students should be informed when courses are to be conducted using either method of delivery.
2.In the event an instructor records student presentations, he or she must obtain permission from the student using a signed release in order to use the recording for future classes in accordance  with the Use of Student-Created Work guidelines above.
3.Instructors who video-record their class lectures with the intention of re-using some orall of recordings for future class offerings must notify students on the course syllabus if students'   images may appear on video. Instructors are also advised to provide accommodation for students who do not wish to appear in class recordings.
Example: This course employs lecture capture technology to record class sessions. Students may occasionally appear on video. The lecture recordings will be available to you for study purposes  and may also be reused in future course offerings.
No notification is needed if only audio and slide capture is used or if the video only records the instructor's image. However, the instructor is encouraged to let students know the recordings will be available to them for study purposes.

Class Recordings &Student Likenesses

ACROSS THE CURRICULUM

Communication
●(Many Courses) The writing of research papers is required throughout the different courses. Requirements vary and they are often centered on making a historical argument and citing relevant evidence to support the argument.
○Reasoning: These assignments steadily refine students’ ability to craft clear, evidence-based prose, tailor tone to varied audiences, and revise for precision—hallmarks of strong written communication. In the workplace, such skills translate into producing concise analytical reports, policy briefs, and client-facing documents that inform decisions, secure buy-in, and enhance an organization’s credibility.

●(Many Courses) Throughout the semester, students are required to respond to a specific question posted on the discussion board and then interact with their classmates. 
○Reasoning? This develops written communication, active listening, and respectful dialogue—skills that are essential in workplace settings where employees must contribute to group discussions, collaborate across teams, and engage professionally in digital communications like email, Slack, or project management platforms.

●(Many Courses) Through engagement with diverse historical contexts, belief systems, and social structures, these history courses enhance students’ cultural and ethical agility—the ability to understand different worldviews, engage thoughtfully with competing values, and operate effectively in global and multicultural environments. 
○Reasoning: By examining how people across time and place have navigated power, identity, and moral conflict, students develop the perspective and empathy essential for responsible citizenship and professional collaboration in an interconnected world.

Critical Thinking
●MOST COURSES: A hallmark of just about every history course is that students engage with primary and secondary sources. 
○Reasoning: Critical thinking skill are built by evaluating evidence, distinguishing between perspectives, and constructing informed arguments—abilities that translate directly to analyzing information and making sound decisions in the workplace.

Learning & Adaptability 

●(Many Courses) Many upper-level courses require preparing a paper over time - drafting, revising, and incorporating feedback. 
○Reasoning: This iterative process helps students learn from mistakes, refine their thinking, and respond to critique. It builds self-regulation and adaptability, fostering continuous improvement in dynamic, feedback-rich workplaces.

Professionalism & Responsibility

●(ALL COURSES) Students must abide by the UNT Academic Honesty Policy. Such policies cultivate integrity, accountability, and ethical behavior—core values in any professional setting. 
○Reasoning: Just as students are expected to produce original work and give proper credit in school, employees must be trustworthy, follow rules, and take responsibility for their actions in the workplace. Violating these standards can undermine team trust, damage reputations, and lead to serious consequences. 

●(ALL COURSES) Disruptive behavior that interferes with teaching or learning is not allowed at UNT. Students may be asked to leave class and referred to the Dean of Students for possible conduct violations.

●(MOST COURSES) Students are expected to come to class regularly, participate actively in discussions, and complete all readings and written assignments. 
○Reasoning: These academic behaviors reflect workplace-relevant skills such as reliability, preparation, collaboration, and time management—foundational qualities for professional success.



HISTORY 4070 - EUROPEAN THEATER

Critical Thinking
●(HIST 4070) In the European Theater couse, students analyze complex military, political, and social developments, weigh causes and effects, and interpret historical events from multiple perspectives. 
○Reasoning: This sharpens their ability to assess evidence, identify patterns, and make reasoned judgments—skills essential for decision-making in dynamic workplace environments. 
Professionalism & Responsibility
●(HIST 4070) All written work requires the Chicago style citation format.
○Reasoning: This mirrors workplace expectations, where varying submission and formatting standards must be understood and followed precisely to ensure clarity, professionalism, and compliance. 

●(HIST 4070) There is a 10% penalty per day for all late work. 
○Reasoning: This policy reinforces the importance of meeting deadlines—an essential expectation in professional settings where late submissions can delay projects, affect team productivity, and damage credibility. 



HISTORY 2610 - THE UNITED STATES TO 1865

Communication

●(HIST 2610) Students give their undivided attention and support to classmates during discussions, treating the instructor and classmates with respect in any communication online or face-to-face, even when their opinion differs from their own. 
○Reasoning: Respectful and attentive communication, even during disagreements, builds trust, strengthens collaboration, and models the kind of professionalism expected in the workplace.

●(HIST 2610) Students are taught to use 'I' statements to share their own thoughts and experiences to challenge ideas, not individuals. 
○Reasoning: This fosters clear, respectful communication skills that help professionals navigate disagreements, give feedback, and collaborate effectively.

●(HIST 2610) Students are taught to communicate appropriately in digital formats by being mindful of tone, avoiding all caps (which can be seen as yelling), and limiting humor or sarcasm due to potential misinterpretation. They are encouraged to avoid text-speak unless permitted, to proofread and fact-check their messages, and to remember that online posts may be permanent, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful communication. 
○Reasoning: This guidance is especially valuable given that a surprising number of students enter the workforce unaware of these basic norms for professional digital communication. 

●(HIST 2610) Students write critically and analytically about how they are relating and reacting to course content, applying the foundational knowledge of history to understanding present circumstances. Students write critically and analytically about how they are relating and reacting to course content, applying the foundational knowledge of history to understanding present circumstances. 
○Reasoning: Drawing informed conclusions, questioning assumptions, and connecting past and present dynamics is essential in roles that require problem-solving, strategic planning, and understanding the broader context behind decisions or policies.

●(HIST 2610 & 2620) Outcome 1 of the US Survey is to compose an effective narrative that describes and analyzes the history of the United States in response to an analytical question. They must choose among strategies appropriate to historical analysis and select sources from a range of media that are best suited to communicating a particular argument, narrative, or set of ideas. 
○Reasoning: This requires students to organize complex information clearly, tailor messages to different audiences, and support their points with appropriate evidence—skills essential for writing reports, creating presentations, and contributing meaningfully in professional settings.

●(HIST 2610 & 2620) Outcome 4 of the US Survey is for students to analyze and evaluate the ways in which the history of the United States informs the current political, cultural, environmental, and social issues of the United States and its relationship to global issues. 
○Reasoning: This cultivates cultural competence by helping students understand how identity and power shape perspectives, and how to communicate respectfully across differences, contributing to environments where all voices are heard and valued.

Teamwork

●(HIST 2610) The syllabus states, “Each of you is valued in this course for your different experiences, identities, learning styles, and your voices.” 
○Reasoning: This helps students build foundational teamwork skills by promoting respect for different viewpoints and fostering inclusive, collaborative interactions—essential habits in today’s diverse workplaces. 

Critical Thinking
●(HIST 2610) A course learning outcome is to be able to draw direct connections between historical events and their consequential impact.
○Reasoning:  In the workplace, this translates to the ability to evaluate how past decisions or market trends affect current outcomes—such as understanding why a policy failed, predicting customer behavior based on previous campaigns, or adjusting a project plan in response to prior missteps—thereby improving strategic planning and organizational learning.

●(HIST 2610 & 2620) The syllabus notes that history is the only guide we have to the decisions that will shape our future, and that the study of history allows us to see parallels, analogies, and recurrent patterns, detect long-term trends and forces, and examine how past decisions shape and limit future options. 
○Reasoning: In the workplace, these analytical skills help individuals assess complex situations, anticipate consequences, and make informed decisions based on context and precedent. 

●(HIST 2610 & 2620) Outcome 2 of the US Survey is for students to identify and differentiate sources, understand context and perspective, and analyze how sources inform narratives. 
○Reasoning; This mirrors the workplace need to evaluate information from different perspectives and apply it appropriately to tasks or decisions.

●(HIST 2610 & 2620) Outcome 3 of the US Survey is that students are able to identify, describe, analyze, and evaluate multiple historical interpretations within the context of the United States. 
○Reasoning: These are direct parallels to skills employers need in roles involving strategy, assessment, judgment calls, and innovation.

Learning & Adaptability 

●(HIST 2610, 3495.001 & 4224) The syllabus is subject to change at the professor’s discretion. 
○Reasoning: This mirrors the professional world, where project scopes, deadlines, and expectations often shift, and employees must adapt to evolving priorities and leadership decisions. 

Motivation & Initiative
●(HIST 2610 & 2620) The instructor encourages students to meet with them over Zoom to discuss any aspect of the course or any other topic on their minds. The instructor emphasizes their open-door policy and a commitment to being a resource and support for students in any way possible.
○Reasoning:  This fosters student initiative and models help-seeking behavior, encouraging learners to take ownership of their progress—an essential habit for success in the workplace.

Digital Literacy

●(HIST 2610) This remote course is conducted entirely online. 
○Reasoning: Students develop time management, digital communication, and self-directed learning skills that are essential for success in modern, technology-driven workplaces.




History 4260.004 - HISTORY AND THE MEDICAL HUMANITIES

Critical Thinking
●(HIST 4260.004) In the History and the Medical Humanities Course, students question the relationship between medical and humanistic knowledge, challenge discourses, and engage in analysis of contrasting perspectives (e.g., science vs spirituality, disease vs illness). 
○Reasoning: In the workplace, where clear-cut answers are rare, the ability to navigate ambiguity enables employees to make thoughtful decisions, anticipate unintended consequences, and contribute meaningfully to complex problem-solving and innovation. 

●(HIST 4260.004) Students attend a performance of Anatomies on campus (produced by the Dance and Theatre Department) and subsequently write a 750-word critical review of the performance. 
○Reasoning: This requires students to observe closely, interpret meaning, assess effectiveness, and support their analysis with evidence. In the workplace, these skills come into play when employees are asked to evaluate a proposal, give feedback on a marketing campaign, assess user experience, or contribute to strategic decisions—situations where thoughtful, well-reasoned input is valued over surface-level opinion.

Creativity & Problem-Solving
●(HIST 4260.004) The final project can be a creative narrative or a research paper based on an experience the student has had with medicine, whether as a patient, caregiver, intern, shadow student, emergency medical services member, or in another role. 
○Reasoning: This activity fosters creativity by asking students to interpret personal experiences through original storytelling or analysis, and to express complex ideas in engaging and meaningful ways.

## New Task
Now, based on the examples above, extract and write the EEQ-aligned output for the following syllabus. Return your response in **exactly the same format** as the example output.

 Follow these rules exactly when producing the output:

1. **Group by EEQ Category**  
   - Identify all relevant EEQ Categories mentioned in the syllabus (e.g., Communication, Critical Thinking, Learning & Adaptability, Professionalism & Responsibility, Teamwork, Motivation & Initiative, Creativity & Problem-Solving, Digital Literacy, etc.).
   - Use the EEQ Category name as a section heading (capitalize first letters).  
   - The EEQ Categories should appear in the order they are found in the syllabus, or in a logical grouping if multiple appear together.

2. **Format within each EEQ Category**  
   - Each item must begin with a parenthetical prefix indicating the course code or scope:  
     - Example: `(HIST 2610)` or `(Many Courses)` or `(Most Courses)` or `(All Courses)`  
     - Multiple course codes should be joined with `&` (e.g., `(HIST 2610 & 2620)`).
   - Immediately after the prefix, write the exact activity, policy, requirement, or expectation described in the syllabus, in complete sentences.
   - After the description, on a **new line**, write a **Reasoning** paragraph that begins with exactly:  
     `Reasoning:` followed by an explanation of how this activity develops the stated EEQ skill and why that skill matters in the workplace.  
   - Always use `Reasoning:` (with a colon), even if the original text has `Reasoning?`.

3. **Spacing and line breaks**  
   - Leave one blank line between items.  
   - Within each EEQ Category, list items one after another with no numbering or bullet points.

4. **Content extraction rules**  
   - Extract all syllabus content relevant to EEQ development.  
   - Preserve exact course codes and scope identifiers from the syllabus.  
   - If a single description applies to multiple courses, include all relevant course codes in the prefix.  
   - Keep all Reasoning explanations intact and written in full sentences.  
   - Remove duplicate items if they are identical in both description and reasoning.

Follow these rules exactly when producing the output, and make every effort to closely mimic the format of the example provided before.
